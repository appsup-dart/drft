# Getting Started

This guide will help you get started with DRFT and create your first resource stack.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Dart SDK 3.0 or higher
- A Dart project (or create a new one)

### Add DRFT to Your Project

Add DRFT to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  drft: ^0.1.0
```

Then install dependencies:

```bash
dart pub get
```

## Your First Stack

Let's create a simple stack with a mock resource to get familiar with DRFT.

### 1. Create a Stack

```dart
import 'package:drft/drft.dart';

void main() async {
  final stack = DrftStack(
    name: 'my-first-stack',
    providers: [
      MockProvider(), // For testing
    ],
    resources: [
      // We'll add resources here
    ],
  );
}
```

### 2. Define a Resource

For now, let's use a simple test resource. In a real scenario, you'd use resources from providers like Firebase, AWS, etc.

```dart
final stack = DrftStack(
  name: 'my-first-stack',
  providers: [MockProvider()],
  resources: [
    TestResource(
      id: 'my-resource',
      name: 'Hello DRFT',
    ),
  ],
);
```

### 3. Plan Changes

Before applying changes, always plan first to see what will happen:

```dart
final plan = await stack.plan();
print(plan.summary);
```

This will show you what operations DRFT will perform (create, update, or delete).

### 4. Apply Changes

Once you're happy with the plan, apply it:

```dart
final result = await stack.apply(plan);
print(result.summary);
```

## Understanding the Workflow

DRFT follows a simple workflow:

1. **Define** your desired resources in code
2. **Plan** to see what changes will be made
3. **Apply** to execute the changes
4. **State** is automatically tracked

## Next Steps

- Check out [Examples](/examples) for more complex scenarios
- Learn about [Resources](/resources) and [Providers](/providers)
- Read the [Architecture](/architecture) guide to understand how DRFT works

## Common Tasks

### View Current State

```dart
final state = await stack.stateManager.load();
print('Current resources: ${state.resources.length}');
```

### Refresh State

Refresh state from the actual system:

```dart
final state = await stack.refresh();
```

### Destroy Resources

To remove all resources:

```dart
final plan = await stack.plan();
// Filter for delete operations if needed
await stack.apply(plan);
```

## Troubleshooting

### State File Not Found

If you see errors about state files, DRFT will create them automatically. Make sure you have write permissions in your project directory.

### Provider Not Found

Ensure you've added the correct provider to your stack and that it's properly configured.

### Resources Not Updating

Check that your resource definitions match the actual state. Use `refresh()` to sync state.
