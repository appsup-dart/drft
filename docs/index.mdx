# DRFT

**DRFT** (pronounced "drift") is an infrastructure-as-code toolkit written in Dart. It allows you to describe your infrastructure declaratively using Dart code, leveraging Dart's expressive syntax and type system.

## What is DRFT?

DRFT enables you to:

- **Declare infrastructure** using clean, type-safe Dart code
- **Compare states** between desired and actual infrastructure
- **Plan changes** before applying them
- **Execute changes** to bring infrastructure to the desired state
- **Manage state** to track infrastructure resources

## Quick Start

### Installation

Add DRFT to your `pubspec.yaml`:

```yaml
dependencies:
  drft: ^0.1.0
```

### Basic Example

```dart
import 'package:drft/drft.dart';

void main() async {
  final stack = DrftStack(
    name: 'my-infrastructure',
    providers: [
      MockProvider(), // For testing
    ],
    resources: [
      // Your resources here
    ],
  );

  // Plan changes
  final plan = await stack.plan();
  print(plan.summary);

  // Apply changes
  final result = await stack.apply(plan);
  print(result.summary);
}
```

## Key Features

- **Type Safety**: Leverage Dart's strong typing for infrastructure definitions
- **Immutable Resources**: Flutter-style immutable resources with final properties
- **Clean Syntax**: Familiar Dart constructor syntax, just like Flutter widgets
- **State Management**: Automatic state tracking and comparison
- **Dependency Resolution**: Automatic handling of resource dependencies
- **Plan Before Apply**: Always see what will change before making changes
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new providers and resources
- **Idempotent**: Running the same configuration multiple times is safe

## Why DRFT?

### For Dart/Flutter Developers

If you're already working with Dart and Flutter, DRFT feels natural. The syntax is familiar, the type system is the same, and you can leverage your existing Dart knowledge.

### Type Safety

Unlike configuration-based tools, DRFT provides compile-time type checking. Catch errors before they reach production.

### Clean Syntax

Define infrastructure the same way you define Flutter widgets - with clean, declarative constructors.

```dart
final stack = DrftStack(
  name: 'production',
  providers: [AwsProvider(region: 'us-east-1')],
  resources: [
    VirtualMachine(
      name: 'web-server',
      image: 'ubuntu-22.04',
      size: 'medium',
    ),
  ],
);
```
